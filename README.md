This code is an emotion classification model using PyTorch. When you run it, it prompts the user to enter text via the command line. The entered text is converted to ASCII values and sent to a simple model for emotion prediction. After processing the text, the code displays the emotion classification (such as "happy" or "sad") directly on the screen. The program can be exited by typing "exit" in the command prompt
